# Full-Stack Developer Challenge
​
Here's a little challenge for you. Take as much liberty with it as you wish. We're looking for a **basic web app** with a database and **CRUD** functionality.
​

​
## Notes app
​
### Description
Simple notes web application for taking notes. It should be a simple website that lets the user create, edit and delete notes. The user should be able to mark a note as **completed**.
​
### Requirements
 - Web application with basic routing and forms.
 - Server/serverless functions (to interect with the database)
 - Database to store the notes
 - Either front-end, backend or both must use typescript.
​
​
### Implementation
​
Use whatever stack you see fit. At Connected Insurance, we use a React (TS) + Node (Serverless Lambdas) + TailwindCSS stack. Some lambdas are written in Python.
​
You can choose to deploy the application on Netlify/Heroku/etc (free tier available), or keep it local. Same goes for the databse - deploy it or have a local instance.
​
If you decide to go with a local approach, a **README** with instructions on how to run the application would be much appreciated.
​
​
### Bonus Points
​
Use a new or unfamiliar technology somewhere in the project. Could be something big like **SolidJS, Svelte, Remix, Rust, GraphQL** or something less intense such as an ORM you haven't used before. Or you could choose to omit the ORM part altogether.
​
User authentication can be time-consuming. However, if you feel like up to the challenge, it would certainly impress us.
​
​
### Alloted time
We feel that one work day (8h) should be more than enough to complete the required parts of the challenge.
